Here is the complete guide to deploy Alexa Music on Railway and Heroku with detailed images. You have to make some changes if you want to deploy this music bot. Firstly, you have to fork both the main project and Alexa bypass. If you don't want to edit the repo and want to use Alexa Original vars, simply click on the above button. If you want to add your own name, like channel name or support group, then you have to edit the Alexa repo. All the processes are given below.

### sᴛᴇᴘ ɴᴜᴍʙᴇʀ 1

- After that, edit the `Readme.md` file, and in the `Deploy To Heroku` section, change the GitHub username and Repo name to your own repo name that you have forked.

### sᴛᴇᴘ ɴᴜᴍʙᴇʀ 2
- If you want to edit the repository, open the forked repository that you have forked from Alexa Music and change the name that I have used in the repository, such as support group, channel, owner name, etc.
- Open `AlexaMusic` in your forked repository, then go to `AlexaMusic/strings/langs/en.yml` and locate where I have used my channel name, etc. Make sure to change only the username and not change any `{}`, `0` words, like that.
- Furthermore, you can visit `AlexaMusic/strings/helpers.py` to replace my usernames with yours.
- After that, go to `AlexaMusic/AlexaMusic/utils/inline/play.py` for further editing of the play button, which will show when the song is playing.
- In the picture given below i have mentioned which file you need to edit to add your own values.
